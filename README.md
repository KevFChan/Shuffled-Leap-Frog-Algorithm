# 🐸 Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm

This repository contains my **Optimization & Computation final project**, where I analyze and break down the **Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA)** — a memetic metaheuristic optimization method inspired by frog population social behavior and evolutionary strategies.

The original project paper was written in **LaTeX**, but I no longer have access to the `.tex` source due to an expired university email account. However, the documentation, code, and presentation materials included here summarize the core methodology and results.

## 📌 Overview
The **Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA)** combines concepts from both **genetic algorithms** and **particle swarm optimization**. A population of frogs is partitioned into memeplexes, which evolve independently through local search before being periodically shuffled to exchange knowledge and prevent premature convergence.

For this project, I explained why the SFLA is valid, analyzed the global convergence of the algorithm using Markov chains, and compared the superior performance against other established algorithms in the context of neural network training.
